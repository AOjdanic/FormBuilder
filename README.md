This project has been built with following technologies:

1. Vite as development environment
2. React - as a main library for building the applications' user interface
3. Tailwind CSS - for styling
4. Firebase - hosting service

In order to run this project locally, use command 'git clone https://github.com/AOjdanic/FormBuilder.git' in your local CLI

After that, switch to project root directory and run 'npm i'. For running a local development server, Vite uses a command 'npm run dev'. The build command in Vite is 'npm run build' and the folder containing build files is the 'dist' folder.

NOTE: Since this project uses Tailwind CSS which heavily relies on different classes, it is a recommendation to install an extension which hides classnames for improved readability. One such extension is called Inline fold made by Mohammed Alamri

This application features a tool for building form elements and a tool for styling the entire form, down to the very element you are creating.

Besides that, it allows you to create elements through simple text input, or in JSON format. Through the JSON field, you can alter, reorder, create or remove form elements as you wish.

Lastly, when you are done building the form, you can always get the raw form HTML as well as all the styles you applied in the form and all its elements.
